# Elasticity_curve_analysis
This repository contians the analysis portion of the code for the manuscript entitled: "Elasticity curves describe streamflow sensitivity to precipitation across the entire flow distribution", submitted to HESS in 2022. 

1. To run this script, download the associated files
2. This includes a folder called toy_example and a subfolder called "data". The data folder contains: 
1 preprocessed streamflow file containing daily flow percentile and climatological data adapted from PRISM: "flow_data_rewrite" and one file containing 
    catchment attributes data: "mods" which were compiled and prcessed separately. 
2. To run the script, change the "root.dir" to the complete file path of where you've stored this data. 
3. "knit" the document
